    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <hr>
    <span class="story">We’ve always done things differently. Born from the idea that staffing could be less about financial gain and 
        corporate in-roads, and more about genuine relationships and meaningful impact, the company was founded as 
        an entrepreneurial start-up in 2001. Since then, we’ve grown exponentially, and in a number of ways.</span>
    <span class="story">Today, we are a purpose-driven company that’s dedicated to empowering people through the value of opportunity. 
        We give it our all to put people to work.</span>

    <span class="working-with-content m-5">One big positive for me is Apex ensures there is a continuous dialogue with the client and wants to make sure the candidates are qualified and progressing as expected…. they are professionals with a 
        strong customer focus. Apex Account Managers go the extra mile to ensure qualified candidates are presented and are always keeping in 
        touch. That is important in this business. "</span>
